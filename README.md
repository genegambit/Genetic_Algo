## Genetic Algorithm using Python Programming

### Prerequisites

* Python
* Biopython

Here a Genetic Algorithm is written using the Python Progamming language.
The algorithm finds a protein sequence that best aligns with two given protein sequences.
Ten thousand iterations are performed, and the approximate run time for the program (with sequence length of 100) is just under 5 minutes.
